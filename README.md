## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Usage Guide

### Creating States

1. Enter a state name in the input field
2. Click "Add" to create a new state
3. States appear in the left panel

### Managing Rules

1. Select a state to view/edit its rules
2. Click "Add Rule" to create a new transition rule
3. Define:
   - Condition: When this rule should trigger
   - Next State: Where to transition when triggered

### Saving and Loading

- **Save Flow**: Click to save current configuration
- **Export**: Download configuration as JSON
- **Import**: Load a previously exported configuration

### Simulation

1. Click "Simulate" to enter simulation mode
2. Test your state machine's behavior
3. Observe state transitions based on rules

### Theme Toggle

- Click the sun/moon icon to switch between light and dark modes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Lost Configuration**
   - Use the Import feature to restore from backup
   - Check local storage in browser

2. **States Not Saving**
   - Ensure clicking "Save Flow" after changes
   - Check browser storage permissions

3. **Import Issues**
   - Verify JSON format matches export structure
   - Check file permissions

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Export configurations regularly
   - Keep backup files organized

2. **State Naming**
   - Use descriptive names
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

3. **Rule Management**
   - Keep conditions clear and specific
   - Verify all transitions are valid
