  greeting: "I'm analyzing your log files in demo mode. What would you like to know about your logs?",
  default: "Based on my analysis of your log files, I can see several patterns. There appear to be some connection issues and authentication errors in these logs. I also notice some resource utilization spikes that might indicate a performance bottleneck. Would you like me to focus on a specific area?",
  error: "I've identified several error patterns in your logs:\n\n1. Database connection failures at timestamps 15:42:13 and 16:03:27\n2. Multiple failed authentication attempts from IP 192.168.1.105\n3. Memory usage spike to 92% at 15:58:32\n\nThe database errors appear to be related to timeout issues, possibly due to high query volume. Would you like me to provide more details on any of these issues?",
  performance: "Analyzing performance patterns in your logs:\n\n- Response time increased from avg 120ms to 350ms between 15:45 and 16:15\n- Database query time doubled during this period\n- Memory utilization peaked at 92%\n- CPU usage remained steady at 70-75%\n\nThis suggests a database-related bottleneck rather than a CPU constraint. The logs show several slow queries that might benefit from optimization.",
  authentication: "Authentication analysis of your logs:\n\n- 7 failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.105 between 15:40-15:43\n- 3 successful logins from the same IP at 15:44\n- 2 password resets for user 'jsmith' at 15:39\n\nThis pattern could indicate a brute force attempt that eventually succeeded. I recommend reviewing the account activity for 'jsmith' and possibly implementing additional security measures like IP-based rate limiting.",
  summary: "Summary of log activity between 15:30-16:30:\n\n- 12 error events (7 authentication, 3 database, 2 resource)\n- 3 warning events (all performance related)\n- 2 critical events (memory usage at 15:58, database timeout at 16:03)\n\nMost urgent issues appear to be related to database performance and resource constraints. There's also a potential security concern with multiple failed login attempts."
